# OpenMathProblemsSolutions
A Collection of Solutions to different Math Problems including Math Competitions and a broad range of Theoretical Problems in different Quantitative Fields

# Manifesto 

There is plenty of very interesting math problems around, solving which can help to improve the Art of Problem Solving. 
Problem Solving is in fact a real art, it is not just erudition or intelligence: sure these elements are required but problem solving goes beyond them and requires more, some “personal magic” needs to be added. This is also what makes each solution so unique. 

It's not just about the actual result but the path that has been followed 

My goal is to train myself with some interesting problems and share the solutions so to let you know me a little better, surely better I'd be able to explain with just plain words
